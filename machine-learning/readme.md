**📘 Course: Machine Learning**

**📌 Tasks included:**

- Classification and regression problems
- Model evaluation
- Unsupervised learning
- Neural networks

**🏁 Final Project**

For the final project, I was required to use all my acquired knowledge to solve a regression or classification problem of my choice.\
I explored whether it’s possible to predict lap times during the race in **Formula 1** (regression problem) based on simple data that is available to anyone, such as:

- Previous lap time
- Current driver’s position
- Lap Number
- Best qualifying time
- Track
- Driver's pitstop situation

I used different approaches such as:

- Neural Network (using PyTorch)
- Random Forest Regression
- Linear Regression (with and without regularization, feature scaling)
  Additionally, data preprocessing (using Pandas) was an essential part of the project.
  I used a **comprehensive dataset** with information about **laps, drivers, and more** from **1950 to 2023**, so there was a plenty of data to train on.
