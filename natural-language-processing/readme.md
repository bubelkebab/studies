**🏁 Final Project**
[External Repository](https://git.wmi.amu.edu.pl/s481825/PJN-PROJEKT)
For the final project, we worked in a **3-person team** to develop an application that utilizes **NLP methods** as extensively as possible to solve a real-world problem.

Our team created an app in Python called **"Filmosfera"**, a **movie recommendation system** 
based on user descriptions in natural language.

**🛠 How it works?**

Users can type in **natural language** what they would like to watch, mentioning:
- Plot description
- Favorite or disliked actors
- Preferred or unpreferred genres

Based on that, the system recommends the **top 10 best-matching movies**.\
*Due to dataset limitations, English is the only supported language.*

**📊 Data & NLP Methods**
- Dataset: Collected from *IMDB* using a **web scrapper** that we built.
- Used NLP methods:
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Cosine vector similarity
  - Euclidean distance
  - Sentiment analysis (Enchanced by using LLM's)
